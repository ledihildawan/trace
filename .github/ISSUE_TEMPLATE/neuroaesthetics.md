## Pre-submission Checklist

<!-- Please check the following before submitting: -->

- [ ] I have searched existing issues to ensure this neuroaesthetics issue hasn't been reported
- [ ] I have read the TRACE Philosophy in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] I understand that TRACE prioritizes "feel" over "function"

## Neuroaesthetics Category

<!-- What aspect of the meditative experience is affected? -->

- [ ] 🌊 **Motion Curves** — Animation timing, easing, fluidity
- [ ] 🧘 **Psychological Impact** — Stress, distraction, mental load
- [ ] ⏰ **Temporal Perception** — How time "feels" in the interface
- [ ] 🎵 **Rhythm & Pacing** — Visual or interaction rhythm
- [ ] 🌙 **Ambient Feel** — Overall atmosphere and mood
- [ ] 💫 **Other:** ___________

## Experience Description

<!-- Describe the experience or feeling you're reporting. -->
<!-- Focus on HOW it feels, not just what it does. -->
<!-- TRACE is "felt rather than used" — describe the sensation. -->

## Current Experience

<!-- How does the current implementation feel? -->
<!-- Use descriptive language: jarring, rushed, calm, anxious, etc. -->

## Desired Experience

<!-- How should this ideally feel? -->
<!-- Reference the meditative, zen-like qualities TRACE aims for. -->

## Affected Interaction

<!-- Which interaction or element affects this experience? -->

| Field           | Value                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction** | e.g., Long press, Hover, Transition      |
| **Element**     | e.g., Timeline, Navigation, Date cell    |
| **Trigger**     | e.g., User action, Automatic, Time-based |

## TRACE Motion Standards

<!-- For reference, TRACE requires: -->
<!-- - Fluid motion with `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` or physics-based timing -->
<!-- - No linear animations -->
<!-- - Smooth transitions that respect temporal perception -->
<!-- - Animations that enhance rather than distract -->

### Motion Analysis (Optional)

<!-- If reporting a motion issue, provide timing details: -->

| Property     | Current Value | Suggested Value                  |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Duration** |               |                                  |
| **Easing**   |               | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` |
| **Delay**    |               |                                  |

## Screenshots / Recordings

<!-- Screen recordings are ESPECIALLY helpful for motion/feel issues. -->
<!-- Show the current behavior and describe what's wrong with the feeling. -->

## Environment

<!-- Please complete the following information: -->

| Field               | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Device**          | e.g., MacBook Pro, iPad, iPhone        |
| **OS**              | e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sonoma, iOS 17 |
| **Browser**         | e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox          |
| **Browser Version** | e.g., Chrome 120.0.6099.109            |

## Psychological Context

<!-- Help us understand the impact on user wellbeing: -->

- [ ] This causes mental fatigue or eye strain
- [ ] This creates a sense of urgency or anxiety
- [ ] This breaks the meditative/calm state
- [ ] This feels inconsistent with other TRACE interactions
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Suggested Improvement

<!-- If you have ideas on how to improve the feel, share them. -->
<!-- Consider: timing, easing, visual feedback, removal of elements -->

## Philosophy Alignment

<!-- Explain how your suggestion aligns with TRACE principles: -->

| Principle              | How This Helps |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| **Zero-UI**            |                |
| **Temporal Fading**    |                |
| **Fluid Motion**       |                |
| **Performance as Zen** |                |

## Additional Context

<!-- Any other context about the neuroaesthetic experience? -->
<!-- Have you experienced similar feelings in other apps? -->
<!-- Reference any design/psychology research if applicable. -->
