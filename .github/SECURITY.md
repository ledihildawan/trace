## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TRACE seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

Instead, please report security issues by emailing:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability

3. **Resolution**: We aim to release a fix within **30 days** for critical issues
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing

### Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure. If you make a good faith effort to:

- Avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure
- Avoid exploiting issues beyond what's necessary to demonstrate them

We will:

- Not pursue legal action against you
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- Credit you in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

When contributing to TRACE, please follow these security guidelines:

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- **Validate all user inputs** if implementing new features
- **Use HTTPS** for all external resources
- **Keep dependencies updated** and audit for vulnerabilities
